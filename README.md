# Ferris Wheel Plan!

#### Overview
- My goal is to create a minature ferris wheel, controlled by a raspberry pi and a continuous servo. The device will be connected by a series of gears and can change direction with a switch on the back. I think this project will highlight my strengths because it requires some intricate CAD designing, which is exactly what I enjoy doing.

#### Resources/Materials
- 1 servo
- 3mm acryllic
- #4-40 screws and nuts
- raspberry pi and breadboard
- 3D printed material
- LEDs
- switch

#### Schedule
week 1 & 2: design the wheel, base, and stability pieces

Week 3 & 4: design and refine gears, add in servo holder and breadboard

Week 5 & 6: write code and set up wiring

#### Ideas
- two trapezoial pieces will be upright on the front and back of the actual wheel
- the piece on the back will have the circuit board attached to it; the one on the front will have cut outs in the middle to save material
