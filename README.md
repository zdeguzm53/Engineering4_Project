# Ferris Wheel Plan!

#### Overview
- My goal is to create a minature ferris wheel, controlled by a raspberry pi and a continuous servo. The device will be connected by a series of gears and can change direction with a switch on the back. I think this project will highlight my strengths because it requires some intricate CAD designing, which is exactly what I enjoy doing.

#### Resources/Materials
- 1 servo
- 3mm acryllic
- #4-40 screws and nuts
- raspberry pi and breadboard
- 3D printed material
- LEDs
- switch

#### Schedule
Week 1. construct the base of the ferris wheel



#### Ideas
- still thinking of them...
